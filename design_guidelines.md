# Tangible India - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach** - Drawing inspiration from educational platforms like Duolingo and interactive storytelling apps, combined with the vibrant, accessible design patterns of modern Indian digital products.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Saffron: 25 85% 55% (vibrant orange representing the Indian flag)
- Deep Blue: 220 70% 25% (navy for serious facts and text)
- Forest Green: 140 60% 30% (for positive achievements)

**Accent Colors:**
- Warm Red: 15 75% 50% (for satirical/critical facts)
- Gold: 45 80% 60% (for highlighting special numbers like 0)

**Background:**
- Light mode: Cream white with subtle warm undertones
- Dark mode: Deep charcoal with warm brown undertones

### Typography
- **Primary:** Poppins (Google Fonts) - modern, clean, excellent for numbers
- **Secondary:** Inter (Google Fonts) - for body text and descriptions
- **Accent:** Mukti (Google Fonts) - for special Indian context elements

### Layout System
**Spacing:** Tailwind units of 3, 6, 12 for consistent rhythm (p-3, m-6, gap-12)

### Component Library

**Number Display Card:**
- Large, prominent number with Indian numeral system option toggle
- Fact cards with expandable content
- Color-coded by fact type (satirical/serious/achievement)
- Smooth card animations on reveal

**Navigation:**
- Floating progress indicator showing current position in sequence
- Quick jump controls with number input
- Search overlay with number/keyword functionality

**Fact Categories:**
- Achievement badges (green)
- Satirical markers (warm red with humor icons)
- Historical context (saffron)
- Statistical data (blue)

## Visual Treatment

**Interactive Elements:**
- Number progression uses a visual timeline metaphor
- Cards slide in from right as users progress
- Subtle parallax on background elements
- Hover states with gentle scale transforms

**Indian Design Elements:**
- Subtle geometric patterns inspired by traditional Indian art
- Lotus motifs for navigation elements
- Color transitions reminiscent of Indian textiles

## Content Strategy
- Single-screen focus per number with expandable details
- Visual hierarchy: Number → Primary Fact → Additional Context
- Share functionality for interesting discoveries
- Bookmark system for favorite facts

## Images
No large hero image needed. Instead, use:
- Small illustrative icons for each fact category
- Subtle background pattern with Indian geometric motifs
- Infographic-style visualizations for statistical facts
- Historical imagery thumbnails where relevant (small, contextual)

The design emphasizes the numerical journey over visual overwhelm, keeping focus on the educational content while maintaining an engaging, distinctly Indian aesthetic.
